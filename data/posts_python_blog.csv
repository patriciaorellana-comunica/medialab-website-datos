something completely differentUpon this every soul was confounded; for the phenomenon just then
observed by Ahab had unaccountably escaped every one else; but its very
blinding palpableness must have been the cause.Thrusting his head half way into the binnacle, Ahab caught one
glimpse of the compasses; his uplifted arm slowly fell; for a moment he
almost seemed to stagger. Standing behind him Starbuck looked, and lo!
the two compasses pointed East, and the Pequod was as infallibly going
West.But ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew, the
old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed, “I have it! It has happened
before. Mr. Starbuck, last night’s thunder turned our compasses—that’s
all. Thou hast before now heard of such a thing, I take it.”“Aye; but never before has it happened to me, sir,” said the pale
mate, gloomily.Enjoy the new releaseThanks to all of the many volunteers who help make Python Development

the cables and chains confining the whales to the ship.“What now?” said the Guernsey-man, when the Captain had returned to
them.“Why, let me see; yes, you may as well tell him now that—that—in
